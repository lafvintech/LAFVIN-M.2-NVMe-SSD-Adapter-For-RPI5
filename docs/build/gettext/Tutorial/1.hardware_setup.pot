msgid "You need to know the IP address of the Raspberry PI to connect through VNC. Usually, you can use the 'ping-4 raspberrypi.local' command in the command line or terminal of your computer, or find the IP address by checking the list of connected devices on your router. Also, please ensure that you have enabled the VNC server on the Raspberry PI (this can be done by running 'sudo raspi-config' 'and then selecting Interface Options -> VNC -> Yes)."
