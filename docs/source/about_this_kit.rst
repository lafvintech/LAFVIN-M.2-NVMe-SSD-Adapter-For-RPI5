   *LAFVIN M.2 NVMe SSD Adapter*

Introduction
============

The N04 is an NVMe M.2 SSD PCIe peripheral board (PIP) designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi 5. It utilizes the Pi 5's PCIe interface to connect NVMe M.2 SSDs (compatible with 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 sizes, supporting PCIe Gen3), enabling rapid data transfer and high-speed system booting.

The N04 board conforms to the standard Raspberry Pi HAT dimensions and supports the four common NVMe SSD sizes: 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280. The kit includes SSD mounting screws, allowing users to easily install different SSD sizes as needed.
